# 🐢🚀 Back to the roots: Node.js

Node.js from scratch with no frameworks and no dependencies.

## Readline

The readline module in Node.js provides an interface for reading data from a
readable stream, such as the terminal. It allows interacting with the user
through questions, capturing their responses, and performing other line-reading
operations asynchronously. It is widely used in command-line applications and
other contexts where user interaction is needed.

## Usage

1. Follow the instructions for the [prerequisites](https://github.com/ricardospalves/back-to-the-roots-nodejs?tab=readme-ov-file#prerequisites) and [installation](https://github.com/ricardospalves/back-to-the-roots-nodejs?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).

2. Now, run the main.js file with Node.js:

```bash
node readline/main.js
```

3. Now you can answer the question in the terminal.
